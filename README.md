# Ambience_sound_generator

**In this project, we design a graphical user interface (GUI), in which user can select the ambience noise in a selected place from a selected direction. For example, the user can choose to be in a cafe when people are chatting behind the user and we will apply this background noise to the user's input voice according to the direction. We will try to include various different settings.**
